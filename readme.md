##About

[Link to the app](http://michael0x2a.com/portfolio/trending_stack)

This is a short app which lists the most upvoted questions for any given StackExchange 
site and tags over a yearly, monthly, weekly, or yearly basis. 

One of the reasons I love StackExchange is that it's possible to learn a lot by just reading the 
top-voted questions. However, the top-voted questions for any given tag combo generally tends to stay 
static. I wanted to see what other popular questions there were, ignoring ones I've likely 
already read. 

This app is similar to the "week" and "month" tabs, except it also lets you specify tags that 
you're interested in.

I also made this app as a way for me to practice using Javascript, jQuery, and the 
StackExchange API. This was a one-day project, so it'll have some rough edges (sorry).
